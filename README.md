# ALU_verification
This project verifies a parameterized ALU using SystemVerilog with support for arithmetic, logical, compare, and rotate operations. It includes constrained-random tests, functional coverage, assertions, and a reference model. Special cases like multi-cycle ops and input wait logic are also verified.
